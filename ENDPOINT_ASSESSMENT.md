## CONCRETE PROOF OF ISSUES:

### 1. **Shell Session Endpoints Are Broken - DIRECT TEST RESULT**
```
Testing shell session endpoints...

1. Testing POST /shell/session/start
Status: 404
Body keys: []

2. Testing GET /shell/session/list
Status: 404
Body keys: []
```
**PROOF**: Direct endpoint testing shows all shell session endpoints return 404 errors

### 2. **Error Analysis Tests Are Failing - TEST OUTPUT**
```
Expected substring: "exit code 2"
Received string:    "Mock analysis: Non-zero exit code detected."
```
**PROOF**: My recent fix broke existing tests because the mock analysis text changed

### 3. **Session Tests Have Failures - TEST RUNNER OUTPUT**
```
FAIL tests/session/session.uplift.logs.test.js
‚óè session uplift logs ‚Ä∫ records exec-start and timeout when command uplifts
```
**PROOF**: Session-related tests are failing, indicating instability

## AUTOMATED TEST STATUS:
- **Core command execution tests**: PASSING
- **Server management tests**: PASSING  
- **Activity monitoring tests**: PASSING
- **Shell session endpoint tests**: FAILING (404 errors)
- **Error analysis tests**: FAILING (text mismatch)
- **Session logging tests**: FAILING (mock expectations)

## VERDICT:
**DO NOT USE SHELL SESSION ENDPOINTS IN WEB UI DEVELOPMENT** - They are demonstrably broken and return 404 errors. Focus on confirmed working endpoints only.

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
1. **Use only confirmed working endpoints** for initial Web UI development
2. **Avoid shell session endpoints** until they're fixed (they return 404 errors)
3. **Implement all UI with proper error handling** since some endpoints are unstable
4. **Run manual tests** before integrating any endpoint to verify it works

## CONCRETE EVIDENCE SUMMARY:
- ‚úÖ **Working endpoints**: Manually tested and confirmed functional
- üõë **Broken endpoints**: Return 404 errors when directly tested
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unstable endpoints**: Have failing automated tests
- ‚ùì **Untested endpoints**: Require manual verification before use
