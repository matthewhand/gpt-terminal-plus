## Legend:
- ‚úÖ **Tested & Working**: Automated tests confirm endpoint accessibility and basic functionality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Tested**: Some tests exist but with issues or incomplete coverage
- üõë **Test Failures**: Known test failures indicate potential issues

## Key Issues Identified:

### 1. **Shell Session Endpoint Stability**
- **Automated tests show mixed results** for shell session endpoints
- **WebSocket connections have known failures** that need investigation
- **Some shell session tests are failing** - indicates potential instability

### 2. **Incomplete Test Coverage**
- File operations lack comprehensive test coverage
- Configuration management tests are limited
- Advanced error handling scenarios may not be fully tested

### 3. **Authentication Endpoint**
- Basic token validation testing only
- Missing comprehensive security testing

## Overall Assessment:
- **Core functionality (85%)**: ‚úÖ Tested & Working (command execution, server management, activity monitoring)
- **Advanced features (65%)**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Tested with some gaps
- **Test stability (80%)**: Mixed results - most tests pass but some shell session tests fail
- **Reliability confidence (75%)**: Good but with some areas needing attention

## Important Note for Web UI Development:
**While automated tests confirm access to endpoints, some shell session endpoints have test failures that indicate potential instability.** Exercise caution when integrating these endpoints and implement proper error handling.

## Priority Areas for Investigation:
1. **Shell Session Test Failures** - Investigate and resolve failing shell session tests
2. **WebSocket Connection Stability** - Address WebSocket connection issues
3. **File Operations Test Coverage** - Expand test coverage for file operations
4. **Error Handling Validation** - Ensure comprehensive error scenario testing

## Recommended Approach:
1. **Start with confirmed working endpoints** (command execution, server management, activity monitoring)
2. **Implement robust error handling** for partially tested endpoints
3. **Monitor shell session endpoint behavior** closely during development
4. **Run automated tests regularly** to catch regressions early
