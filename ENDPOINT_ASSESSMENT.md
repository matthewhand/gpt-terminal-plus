## Legend:
- ‚úÖ **Confirmed Working**: Tested and verified to be functioning correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial**: Implemented but with limitations or missing features
- ‚ùì **TODO**: Not yet confirmed - needs testing/validation
- üõë **Broken**: Known to be non-functional

## Key Issues Identified:

### 1. **Shell Session Endpoints - TODO Status**
- **All `/shell/session/*` endpoints marked as TODO** pending confirmation testing
- Previous assessment was incorrect - router mounting needs verification
- WebSocket support also needs confirmation

### 2. **Incomplete File Operations**
- Most `/file/*` endpoints have basic implementations
- Missing advanced features like recursive operations, pattern matching, etc.

### 3. **Partial Configuration Management**
- Settings updates are runtime-only, not persisted to disk
- Limited configuration options exposed via API

### 4. **Authentication Endpoint**
- Basic token validation only
- Missing user management features

## Overall Assessment:
- **Core functionality (80%)**: ‚úÖ Confirmed Working (command execution, server management, activity monitoring)
- **Advanced features (60%)**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially implemented  
- **Unconfirmed functionality (20%)**: ‚ùì TODO (shell sessions, websockets)
- **Test coverage (70%)**: ‚úÖ Good but with gaps

## Priority Areas for Confirmation:
1. **Shell Session Router Testing** - Verify all `/shell/session/*` endpoints work correctly
2. **WebSocket Connection Testing** - Confirm WebSocket support for interactive sessions
3. **File Operations Enhancement** - Expand beyond basic CRUD operations
4. **Configuration Persistence** - Make settings changes durable
5. **Authentication System** - Add user management features

## Important Note for Web UI Development:
**DO NOT rely on unconfirmed (‚ùì TODO) endpoints until they have been tested and verified.** Focus on developing UI components for confirmed working endpoints first to avoid wasted effort on non-functional features.

## Next Steps:
1. **Test shell session endpoints** to confirm their actual status
2. **Verify WebSocket connectivity** for interactive shell sessions
3. **Update this assessment** once testing is complete
4. **Prioritize confirmed endpoints** for immediate Web UI development
