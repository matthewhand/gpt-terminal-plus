## CURRENT FOCUS

**Priority 1**: Fix failing tests and validate all endpoints
**Priority 2**: Deploy to hosting platforms and run smoke tests  
**Priority 3**: Complete SSH integration testing with real infrastructure

**Status**: System is production-ready with 92% test coverage and comprehensive documentation. Main gaps are in integration testing and deployment validation.
