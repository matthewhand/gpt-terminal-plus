## Application Logic Overview

- **Startup and Middleware Configuration (`src/index.ts`):**
  Initializes the application, sets up middleware for logging, CORS, JSON parsing, and serves static files. It also configures API routes for handling different types of requests (commands, files, servers).

- **Middleware (`src/middlewares.ts`):**
  Includes middleware for authentication (`checkAuthToken`) and ensuring a server handler instance is attached to requests (`ensureServerIsSet`).

- **Server Handling (`src/utils/ServerConfigUtils.ts`):**
  Contains utilities for listing available servers based on configuration and dynamically instantiating server handlers based on the request context.

- **Server Handlers (`src/handlers/`):**
  Abstract and concrete implementations for interacting with different types of servers (SSH, SSM, local), executing commands, and managing files.

- **Route Handling (`src/routes/`):**
  Defines routes for API endpoints related to commands execution, file operations, and server management. Utilizes server handlers to perform the required operations based on the API request.

- **Utilities (`src/utils/`):**
  Helper functions and utilities for common tasks across the application, such as executing SSH commands, managing server configurations, and more.

## Request Processing Flow

1. **Request Initialization:**
   Middleware checks authentication and sets up the context, including selecting and initializing the appropriate server handler.

2. **API Route Handling:**
   The request is routed to the appropriate handler based on the endpoint. Operations related to server commands, file management, or server configuration are processed.

3. **Server Operation Execution:**
   The server handler associated with the request performs the required operation (e.g., command execution, file operation).

4. **Response Generation:**
   The outcome of the operation is sent back to the client in the response.

This overview outlines the structure and core logic of the application, guiding through its components, their responsibilities, and the general flow of requests.
