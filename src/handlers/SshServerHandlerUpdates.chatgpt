Proposed Enhancements for Error Handling and Debugging in :

1. **Centralized Error Logging**:
- Introduce a centralized logging function that categorizes errors based on severity (debug, info, warning, error).
- Enrich error logs with timestamps, the involved module, and error codes for easier troubleshooting.

2. **Detailed Command Execution Reports**:
- Log the command string, execution time, and outcome (success/failure) for each command executed.
- Log stderr content and error codes for failed commands.

3. **Retry Mechanisms**:
- Implement retry logic for transient errors (e.g., network interruptions).
- Define a retry limit and exponential backoff strategy to avoid overwhelming the server.

These enhancements aim to improve the reliability and maintainability of the SSH connection management, facilitating better troubleshooting and system resilience.
