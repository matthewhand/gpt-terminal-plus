+## Lessons for File and Patch Operations
+
+When AI agents update files, prefer **standard Unix diff/patch tools** to environment-specific helpers.
+
+- Do not assume `apply_patch` is available; it may only exist in certain dev containers.
+- Always generate a **unified diff** using:
+  ```bash
+  diff -u original.md updated.md > change.diff
+  ```
+- Apply with:
+  ```bash
+  patch -p0 < change.diff
+  ```
+  or, if using Git:
+  ```bash
+  git apply change.diff
+  ```
+- Always back up the original file before applying patches:
+  ```bash
+  cp file file.bak
+  ```
+
+This ensures compatibility across all environments and avoids failed patch attempts.
