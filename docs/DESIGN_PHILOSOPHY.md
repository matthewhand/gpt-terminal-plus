# Design Philosophy

The design philosophy of GPT Terminal Plus focuses on providing a secure, isolated, and efficient environment for executing system CLI utilities via HTTP endpoints.

## Key Principles

### Isolation and Security

- **Containerized Execution**: Each tool runs in its own container, providing strong isolation and reducing the risk of one compromised tool affecting others.
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Containerization limits the potential attack surface for each tool, enhancing security.
- **Access Control**: API tokens and optional reverse proxy solutions like nginx secure access to the HTTP endpoints.

### Resource Management

- **Resource Limits**: Docker allows setting resource limits for each container, ensuring one tool doesn't consume excessive resources.
- **Preventing Denial-of-Service**: Resource limits prevent denial-of-service scenarios caused by resource exhaustion.

### Scalability

- **Lightweight Containers**: Docker containers are lightweight and can be easily scaled up or down based on demand.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Scaling allows for efficient resource utilization and potential cost savings in cloud environments.

### Data Persistence

- **Volume Mounting**: If tools need to persist data, appropriate volume mounting strategies should be planned.
- **Data Management**: Ensure data management strategies align with the requirements of each tool.

## Implementation Details

### Containerized Environments

- **Docker Containers**: Each system CLI utility is encapsulated within its own Docker container, ensuring isolation and security.

### Authentication and Authorization

- **API Tokens**: API tokens secure access to the HTTP endpoints.
- **Reverse Proxy**: Optional reverse proxy solutions like nginx enhance security.

### Configuration Management

- **Environment Variables**: Environment variables manage and customize the behavior of each tool.
- **Configuration Files**: Configuration files provide additional customization options.
