# Design Philosophy

The design philosophy of GPT Terminal Plus focuses on providing a secure, isolated, and efficient environment for executing system CLI utilities via HTTP endpoints.

## Key Principles

- **Isolation and Security**: Each tool runs in its own container, providing strong isolation and reducing the risk of one compromised tool affecting others. Containerization limits the potential attack surface for each tool.
- **Resource Management**: Docker allows setting resource limits for each container, ensuring one tool doesn't consume excessive resources, preventing denial-of-service scenarios caused by resource exhaustion.
- **Scalability**: Docker containers are lightweight and can be easily scaled up or down based on demand, allowing for efficient resource utilization and potential cost savings in cloud environments.
- **Data Persistence**: If tools need to persist data, appropriate volume mounting or data management strategies should be planned.

## Implementation Details

- **Containerized Environments**: Each system CLI utility is encapsulated within its own Docker container, ensuring isolation and security.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: API tokens and optional reverse proxy solutions like nginx are used to secure access to the HTTP endpoints.
- **Configuration Management**: Environment variables and configuration files are used to manage and customize the behavior of each tool.
