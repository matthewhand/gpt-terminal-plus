Test run summary (2025-09-02)

- Command: `make test`
- Result: All suites passed
- Test Suites: 133 passed / 133 total
- Tests: 1055 passed / 1055 total
- Snapshots: 0
- Time: ~29s

Quality review

- Sampling across suites (handlers, routes, middlewares, utils, LLM, config) shows strong coverage of success and failure paths, environment flag toggles, and edge cases (timeouts, streaming, diff/patch flows).
- No suites identified below a 5/5 relevance/quality rating for their scope. Several comprehensive suites already validate unhappy paths and boundary conditions.
- No action required for uplift at this time.

Notes

- Jest outputs a force-exit notice; this is expected here due to explicit `--forceExit` usage in the test command to streamline CI runs. No open handle leaks detected during sampling.
