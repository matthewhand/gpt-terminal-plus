# Testing Design for gpt-terminal-plus

This document outlines the testing design for the `gpt-terminal-plus` project, including the imports used, the file structure, and the commands from `package.json` that handle testing.

## Imports

### Used Imports

1. **Jest**: Primary testing framework used for writing and running tests.
   - Mocking functions and modules.
   - Assertions and test runners.
   
2. **Chai**: Assertion library used for BDD/TDD assertions.
   - Provides expressive language for writing tests.
   - Used alongside Jest for more readable assertions.
   
3. **ssh2**: Used for creating SSH connections and executing commands.
   - Mocked in tests to simulate SSH operations.

### Not Used Imports

1. **Sinon**: Not used in our tests. Jest's built-in mocking capabilities are utilized instead.
   
2. **Mocha**: Not used as Jest is our primary testing framework.

## File Structure

The following is an overview of the test file structure:

```
project-root/
├── docs/
│   └── DESIGN.testing.md
├── src/
│   ├── handlers/
│   │   ├── SshServerHandler.ts
│   │   ├── LocalHandler.ts
│   │   ├── SsmHandler.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
├── tests/
│   ├── handlers/
│   │   ├── SshServerHandler.test.ts
│   │   ├── LocalHandler.test.ts
│   │   ├── SsmHandler.test.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
├── package.json
└── ...
```

## Commands from package.json

The `package.json` file includes several scripts for running tests. Here are the relevant commands:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch",
  "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix"
}
```

### Explanation of Commands

1. **test**: Runs all tests once using Jest.
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   
2. **test:watch**: Runs tests in watch mode, rerunning tests when files change.
   ```bash
   npm run test:watch
   ```
   
3. **test:coverage**: Runs tests and generates a code coverage report.
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```
   
4. **lint**: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   
5. **lint:fix**: Runs ESLint with the `--fix` option to automatically fix issues where possible.
   ```bash
   npm run lint:fix
   ```
