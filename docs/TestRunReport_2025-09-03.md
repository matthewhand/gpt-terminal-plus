Test Run Report â€” 2025-09-03

- Command: `make test`
- Node env: `NODE_ENV=test`

Results
- Test Suites: 139 passed / 139 total
- Tests: 1093 passed / 1093 total
- Snapshots: 0 total
- Duration: ~32s
- Lint: 0 errors, 29 warnings (informational only)

Quality Notes
- Suites exercise handlers, routes, middlewares, utils, and LLM integrations with strong coverage and realistic flows.
- Middleware `logMode` tests validate structured `[TODO]` prefix and multiple route patterns.
- No skipped tests, no `.only()` committed; suites run cleanly.
- Jest prints a post-run note about open handles due to `--forceExit`; this is by design for the current harness and not a failure.

Recommendations (non-blocking)
- Consider removing `--forceExit` and enabling `detectOpenHandles` in CI when feasible.
- Optionally address 29 ESLint warnings to tighten code quality; none are test blockers.

Conclusion
- All tests are green; no changes required to resolve failures today.
