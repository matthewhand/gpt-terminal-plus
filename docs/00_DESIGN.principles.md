# Design Principles

## Simplification and Minimalist Approach
- Name files after the function or interface they export.
- Avoid large code files; prefer multiple smaller files.

## Bootstrapping with Documentation
- Begin every chatbot conversation by reading this document.
- Ensure understanding of project principles and requirements.

## Technology Stack
- 2024 Node.js with TypeScript
- 2024 Docker Compose version 2 syntax
- Custom GPT actions (e.g., `gpt-terminal-plus`)

## Custom Actions and CLI Integration
- Utilize `gpt-terminal-plus` for efficient command-line interactions.
- Perform tasks beyond coding, including home automation and database updates.

## Best Practices
- Maintain concise, focused documentation.
- Simplify file structure for easy maintenance.
- Regularly update documentation and ensure consistency.

## Philosophical

- *Simplicity*: Emphasize clear and maintainable code structures that are easy to understand and extend.
- *Modularity*: Promote the separation of concerns by breaking down complex functionalities into smaller, focused components.
- *Consistency*: Maintain uniform naming conventions and code practices across the project to facilitate easier collaboration and maintenance.
- *Documentation*: Ensure comprehensive and accessible documentation to provide context and guidance for both developers and the chatbot.
